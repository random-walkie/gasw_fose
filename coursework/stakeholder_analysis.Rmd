## Our Goal: Identify 4 Key Stakeholders

**What we need to produce:**

- Stakeholder Register with 4 stakeholders (Task 1 - 20 marks)
- Each stakeholder must connect to our use cases and XP stories

**Our specific deliverables:**

- **Use Cases:** "Place Order from retail shop" & "Generate Delivery Note"
- **XP Stories:** "Receive Container delivery" & "Generate monthly invoice"

**Method:** Work backwards from these deliverables to find stakeholders

*Source: CW Task 1 Specification | Appendix A Template*

## Step 1: Extract Stakeholders from Use Cases

**Use Case 1: "Place Order from retail shop"**

- Who places the order? 
- Who receives the order? 
- Who processes the order? 

**Use Case 2: "Generate Delivery Note for Retail Outlet for specialist outdoor garments"**

- Who generates the note? 
- Who receives the delivery? 
- Who supplies the specialist items? 

*Source: CW Task 2 Specifications | FSE_Lecture Slides_Week 5 2425.pdf*

## Step 1: Suggested Answers 

**Use Case 1 Suggestions:**

- Who places the order? → **Retail Shop Staff/Manager**
- Who receives the order? → **Head Office Administrator**
- Who processes the order? → **Supplier** or **Warehouse Staff**

**Use Case 2 Suggestions:**

- Who generates the note? → **Warehouse Manager**
- Who receives the delivery? → **Retail Shop Staff**
- Who supplies the items? → **Chinese Supplier**

*These are suggestions - discuss and decide what makes most sense for our analysis*

## Step 2: Extract Stakeholders from XP Stories

**XP Story 1: "Receive Container delivery from Chinese Supplier"**

- Who benefits from this capability?
- Who's directly involved in the process?

**XP Story 2: "Generate monthly invoice for Trade Customers"**

- Who benefits from getting clear invoices?
- Who would generate these invoices?
- Who receives and pays the invoices?

*Source: CW Task 3 Specifications | FSE_Lecture Slides_Week 3 2425(1).pdf*

## Step 2: Suggested Answers 

**XP Story 1 Suggestions:**

- Who benefits? → **Warehouse Manager** (receives goods)
- Who's involved? → **Chinese Supplier**, **Shipping Company**

**XP Story 2 Suggestions:**

- Who benefits? → **Trade Customers** (get clear billing)
- Who generates? → **Head Office Administrator**
- Who pays? → **Trade Customers**

*These are suggestions - consider what other stakeholders might be involved*

## Step 3: Map to Workwear 4U Scenario

**From the scenario, identify specific roles:**

| Stakeholder Type | Specific Role in Workwear 4U | Key Responsibilities |
|------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Internal Staff** | Head Office Administrator | Manual order processing, supplier contact |
| **Internal Staff** | Warehouse Manager | Container unpacking, stock organisation |
| **Internal Staff** | Retail Branch Manager | Customer orders, stock requests |
| **External** | Chinese Supplier | Container shipments, specialist garments |
| **External** | Trade Customers | Regular bulk orders, account management |
| **External** | UK Suppliers | Direct shop deliveries |

*Source: CW Scenario Description (pages 3-5)*

## Step 4: Select Our 4 Most Important Stakeholders

**Example Selection Criteria:**

1. **Frequency:** Appears in multiple use cases/stories
2. **High Impact:** Directly affected by new system
3. **High Influence:** Can make or break the project
4. **Business Importance:** Critical to Workwear 4U's success

**Our Task:** From our Step 1-3 analysis, count how often each stakeholder appears, then apply business judgment.

## Step 4: Systematic Analysis Results 

**Example Analysis (count how often each stakeholder appears):**

1. **Head Office Administrator** (Use Case 1 + XP Story 2)
2. **Retail Shop Staff/Manager** (Both Use Cases)  
3. **Warehouse Manager** (Use Case 2 + XP Story 1)
4. **Chinese Supplier** (Use Case 2 + XP Story 1)

**Alternative Business-Focused Selection:**

- Replace **Chinese Supplier** with **Trade Customers** (revenue importance)
- Or replace with **UK Suppliers** (volume of transactions)

*The systematic analysis gives us a starting point - we could, for example, apply business judgment for final selection*

## Step 5: Complete the Stakeholder Register

**For each of our 4 stakeholders, fill out:**

| Field | Example: Head Office Administrator |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| **Full Name** | Head Office Administrator |
| **Job Role** | Order Processing Coordinator |
| **Responsibilities** | Manual order entry, supplier communication |
| **System Needs** | Automated order processing, real-time stock data |
| **Power/Interest** | High/High (manages all orders) |
| **Management Strategy** | Involve in all design decisions, regular feedback |

## Validation: Connect Back to Deliverables

**Check our 4 stakeholders against:**

✓ **Frequency Count:** Do they appear most often in our analysis?   
✓ **Use Case Actors:** Do they appear in our use case diagrams?   
✓ **XP Story Value:** Do they benefit from the user stories?   
✓ **System Impact:** Will the new system change how they work?   
✓ **Business Justification:** Can we explain why we chose them over others?   

**Remember:** Multiple valid selections are possible - justify our choices with evidence from the analysis.

## Power/Interest Analysis

**Power = Ability to influence the project**
**Interest = How much the system affects them**

**For each of our 4 stakeholders, assess:**

- What level of power do they have? (High/Medium/Low)
- What level of interest do they have? (High/Medium/Low)
- What management strategy follows from this?

*Source: CW Appendix A | Project Management Framework*

## Power/Interest: Example Assessments 

**Based on systematic analysis (e.g., most frequent stakeholders):**

- **Head Office Administrator:** High Power, High Interest (manages all orders)
- **Retail Shop Staff/Manager:** Medium Power, High Interest (daily system users)
- **Warehouse Manager:** Medium Power, High Interest (container operations)
- **Chinese Supplier:** Low Power, Medium Interest (external but important supplier)

**Alternative business-focused example:**

- Replace **Chinese Supplier** with **Trade Customers:** High Power, Medium Interest (major revenue but external users)

**Management Strategy:** High Power = Keep satisfied, High Interest = Keep informed

*Our power/interest analysis should match our chosen 4 stakeholders*

## Final Checklist

**Before submitting our stakeholder register:**

- ✓ Exactly 4 stakeholders identified
- ✓ Each connects to at least one use case or XP story  
- ✓ Selection justified by systematic analysis (frequency + business importance)
- ✓ Clear, specific role descriptions (not generic)
- ✓ Realistic power/interest assessments for our chosen stakeholders
- ✓ Practical management strategies
- ✓ Follows Appendix A template exactly

**Remember:** Different teams may select different stakeholders - focus on strong justification and systematic approach.
